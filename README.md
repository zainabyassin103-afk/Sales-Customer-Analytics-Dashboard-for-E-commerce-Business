### project overview
In this portfolio project, I conducted a full analysis of an e-commerce company's sales and customer data to extract business insights and visualize key performance metrics. 
The goal was to help the business identify top-selling products, seasonal trends, customer segmentation, and areas for revenue optimization.
### Tools
- Excel - Data cleaning / Data analysis / Data visualization
### Data cleaning
In the initial data cleaning phase, I performed the following tasks:
- remove duplicates.
- Data cleaning and formatting.
- Feature Engineering.
- Data validation. 
### Data Analysis
#### Rating Analysis
Most customers are happy — 59% gave 4 or 5 stars, 21% gave 3 stars, and 20% gave 1 or 2 stars.
Overall, satisfaction is good but there’s still room to improve for some customers.
#### Overall Customer Satisfaction
from the rating categories (1–2=Negative, 3=Neutral, 4–5=Positive) 
The analysis shows that 39.17 % of customers are satisfied, 20.42% are neutral, and 40.41% are unhappy. 
This means the proportion of dissatisfied customers slightly exceeds those who are satisfied, indicating that customer expectations are not being fully met.
This pattern highlights potential issues in product quality, service delivery, communication, or overall customer support, which may be contributing to dissatisfaction and limiting loyalty or repeat purchases.
recommendation is to check feedback or complaints. And add feedback text to make customers write their needs.
#### Product Sales Performance 
The sales data shows that Dyson Vacuum achieved the highest number of units sold (2,179), followed closely by Sony Headphones and Adidas Running Shoes. Meanwhile, Yoga Mat and iPhone 14 recorded the lowest sales, each under 1,900 units. Overall, sales appear relatively balanced across all products, with only a small difference between top and bottom performers. This suggests a diverse product portfolio with consistent customer demand.
